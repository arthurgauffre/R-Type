# Game Engine User Documentation

Welcome to the **Game Engine** documentation! This guide will explain how to use the engine to create, update, and manage entities, components, and systems for your game development. You don't need to know how the engine works internally; this guide will focus on the practical aspects of using the engine for your game.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game engine, you will need:

- A C++ compiler.
- SFML library installed.
- Your project set up to link with the game engine.

Once everything is set up, you can start creating entities, adding components, and using systems to build your game.

---

## Creating Entities

Entities are the building blocks of your game. Each entity can represent anything in the game world, such as a player, enemy, or object. Here's how to create an entity:

```cpp
auto player = _entityManager.createEntity(*id_number*);
auto enemy = _entityManager.createEntity(*id_number*);
```

Each entity has a unique ID and can hold multiple components.

---

## Adding Components to Entities

Components define the properties of an entity, such as its position, velocity, and appearance. Below are examples of how to add different components to an entity.

### VelocityComponent

The `VelocityComponent` controls the speed and direction of an entity's movement.

```cpp
_componentManager.addComponent<component::VelocityComponent>(player->getId(), sf::Vector2f(50.0f, 0.0f));
```

### SpriteComponent

The `SpriteComponent` allows you to assign a sprite (texture) to an entity, making it visible on the screen.

```cpp
auto& sprite = _componentManager.addComponent<component::SpriteComponent>(player->getId());
sprite.setTexture(texture);  // Assuming 'texture' is an sf::Texture loaded earlier
```

---

## Working with Systems

Systems are responsible for updating entities that have certain components. The engine provides several built-in systems such as the `MovementSystem` and `InputSystem`.

### MovementSystem

The `MovementSystem` handles the movement of entities with a `TransformComponent` and `VelocityComponent`. To ensure entities move as expected, the system is updated on each frame.

```cpp
_movementSystem.update(deltaTime, _entityManager.getEntities());
```

### InputSystem

The `InputSystem` handles user input for entities that have an `InputComponent`. You can map keys to actions, such as moving the player or firing a weapon.

```cpp
_inputSystem.update(deltaTime, _entityManager.getEntities());
```

---

## Running the Game Loop

The game loop is the core of your game. It updates all systems, processes events, and renders the entities. Here's a simple example of how to run the game loop:

```cpp
void game::GameLoop::run()
{
    while (_window.isOpen())
    {
        processEvents();
        update();
        render();
    }
}

void game::GameLoop::update()
{
    float deltaTime = _clock.restart().asSeconds();
    _systemManager.update(deltaTime, _entityManager.getEntities());
}
```

Make sure to integrate your systems inside the `update()` function so that they process each frame.

---

## Customizing Keybinds

To customize key bindings for your game, you can assign actions to specific keys in the `InputComponent`. For example:

```cpp
auto& input = _componentManager.addComponent<component::InputComponent>(player->getId());
input.bindKey("MoveUp", sf::Keyboard::W);
input.bindKey("MoveDown", sf::Keyboard::S);
input.bindKey("MoveLeft", sf::Keyboard::A);
input.bindKey("MoveRight", sf::Keyboard::D);
```

These keys can then be processed in the `InputSystem` to control entity actions.

---

Make sure each entity with a `SpriteComponent` is drawn in the window during each frame.

---

## Handling Sound and Music

For adding sound effects and music, the engine provides `SoundComponent` and `MusicComponent`. Hereâ€™s how to add them to an entity:

```cpp
_componentManager.addComponent<component::SoundComponent>(player->getId(), "PathToSound");
_componentManager.addComponent<component::MusicComponent>(player->getId(), "PathToMusic");

game.getSystemManager().addSystem<ECS_system::AudioSystem>(game.getComponentManager());
```

You can then use the `AudioSystem` to play these sounds when needed.

---

## Conclusion

This game engine allows you to manage entities, components, and systems easily without needing to dive deep into the engine's internal workings. With this flexible and modular design, you can add new features, mechanics, and components with minimal effort.

Happy game development!
