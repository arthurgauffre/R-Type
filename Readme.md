# Installation

## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependency:
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

The project is configured to download the dependency automatically.

However you need to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [clang++](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) installed on your machine. If you're on Windows, you need to have [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) installed.

## Build the Project

### On Linux

First you need to clone the latest version of the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JsuisSayker/R-Type.git
```

Then you need to run the following command:
```bash
./launch.sh
```

If the executables `r-type_server` and `r-type_client` are created go to the [Launch section](#launch-the-project).

However if the executables are not created, please look at the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

If you have any questions about the script and his arguments, please run the following command:
```bash
./launch.sh help
```
or
```bash
./launch.sh h
```

### On Windows

First you need to download the ZIP file of the project and extract it.

![Download ZIP](./ressources/Download_zip_file.jpg)

Now you can execute the following command in a terminal:
```bash
.\launch.cmd
```

If the executables `r-type_server` and `r-type_client` are created go to the [Launch section](#launch-the-project).

However if the executables are not created, please look at the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).


# Troubleshooting

Please look at the error message that appear:
- "Please install CMake first.": You can download it [here](https://cmake.org/download/).

- "Please install "Visual Studio 2022" first": You can download it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

# Launch the Project

To launch the R-Type project, you need to run the following commands in a terminal.

First you must launch the server:

```bash
./r-type_server
```

Then launch the client in another terminal to connect to the server:
```bash
./r-type_client
```

For each client that want to connect to the server, you need to launch a new terminal and run the client executable.
